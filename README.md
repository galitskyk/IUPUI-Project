# How to edit markdown files in Microsoft Visual Studios
As a technical writer, you will often work with plain text or markdown files when working on writing projects. 
Rather than use a simple text editor with limited features, you can use [Visual Studios](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 
to easily create, edit and save markdown files. 
Even though Visual Studios is geared toward developers, this tool can accelerate your projects by making your editing process more efficient. 
This user guide will help you maneuver this environment without feeling overwhelmed by the interface and many other capabilities of 
Visual Studios. 

### How to install Markdown Editor in Visual Studios:
