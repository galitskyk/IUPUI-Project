## About this project

This user guide and video tutorial were created for a project for my technical communications certificate at IUPUI. 
To complete this project, I taught myself markdown and became familiarized with GitHub Pages and Visual Studio.  

I used Adobe Captivate to capture video demos and create the video tutorial, 
and I used Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat DC to create and publish the user guide outside of Visual Studios.
